# ds-group3

Each branch contains each member's work and research with the project.
The folders processedKaggleData, mergedQSTKandKaggleData, and AlphaData both contain stock data used for training and testing of the diffeerent models.

Below is a a description of what each branch contains:
* parth_experiments: Implements an Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model, as well as a K-Nearest-Neighbors Model and saves results to an   output CSV file. The process uses a DataHelper class to extract data from the input files. 

* mhd_experiments: Implements an Ordinary Least Squares Regression Model, as well as a K-Nearest-Neighbors Model and saves results to an     output CSV file. The process uses a DataHelper class to extract data from the input files. 
* ira_experiments:
* tare_experiments: This branch contains the DataHelper class to extract data from the input files for the different models to utilize. 
* backtests: This branch contains a framework for backtesting the models in order to generate visualizations and conduct analysis     for model performance against testing data.
